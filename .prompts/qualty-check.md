Analyze the README file for the accuracy of the usage instructions.

You should pay special attention to the following points:
- The documentation must be free of typos.
- The documented configuration options must be in line with actual configuration

supported options should be documented.

At the end of your message, you will summarize your findings in points and only
include those findings that require my attention.
